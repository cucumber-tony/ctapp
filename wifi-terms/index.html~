		<h3>Help! I broke the internet!</h3>
		<p>Sometimes bad stuff happens to good people</p>
		<p>Every now and again stuff breaks, we don't know why, it just happens (it might be something to do with cat videos we're not sure). If you need help using our Wi-Fi just drop us a line oh@ctapp.io and we will get back to you as fast as we can.</p>
		<h3>Presence Analytics</h3>
		<p>We use presence analytics to understand how each of our Wi-Fi hotspots is used; for example, to understand how many people are connected to an individual Wireless Access Point and for how long. This is information is important to us, not least because it allows us to see how popular the Wi-Fi service is and plan how we can improve it. To do this we collect the MAC address of the device you use to connect to the Wi-Fi service as well as the MAC addresses of any device that passes by our access points. Think of it as another way of saying THANK YOU for all this lovely free Wi-Fi.</p>
