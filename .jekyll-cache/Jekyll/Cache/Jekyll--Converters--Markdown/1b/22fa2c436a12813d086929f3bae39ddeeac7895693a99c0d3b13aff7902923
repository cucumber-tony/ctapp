I"Å<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Itâ€™s not easy installing Wi-Fi. Even with top-end kit, the pros still need a helping hand. Follow the basic rules and your network should hum along nicely.</p>

<p>Where you place your WiFi Access Point (AP) can have a bigger impact on your WiFi signal than you might think. Here are some quick pointers on where and where not to place your AP.</p>

<h2>What area do you plan to cover?</h2>

<p>A floor plan is always handy when planning out areas you wish to offer Wi-Fi.
You should start by using the plan and making an estimate of the area that you want to cover.</p>

<p>This will help you visualise the actual space you need to cover, and what areas you might not need to cover at all, as well as potential obstacles and obstructions to the Wi-Fi signal.</p>

<h2>What obstacles are in the way?</h2>

<p>You are never going to see the coverage or distance figure that the manufactures advertise. Mainly because of obstructions between the AP and the end user.</p>

<p>Every time that your WiFi signal passes through a wall or any other obstacle the signal will decrease, reducing the quality for the end user.</p>

<p>Other factors also affect signal performance, including reflecting surfaces like metal and glass. These reflect the WiFi signal and disturb performance. Keep your AP away from these if you can. For example donâ€™t put your AP under a metal counter, the signal will be reflected back and will not penetrate the metal surface.</p>

<h2>Things to avoid doing</h2>

<h3>Tucking your AP away</h3>

<p>As tempting as it might be, you should avoid trying to hide your AP.</p>

<p>Placing your AP in a cupboard/box, under a desk or tucked into the corner of the room can cause a number of issues of varying severity.</p>

<p>By tucking your AP away in places like these, you are putting it in an environment with lots of obstructions. All of which will weaken your signal and leave the Wi-Fi service less than desireable.</p>

<p>Keeping your AP as central to the area you want to cover as possible is generally the best way to go.</p>

<h3>Installing the AP in moist environments</h3>

<p>This may seem obvious, but sometimes stating the obvious helps. Like with any electrical equipment, moist environments such as steamy kitchens or boiler rooms can and will damage your AP and the quality of your Wi-Fi signal.</p>

<p>This can also apply to making sure your AP and cables are out of the way of spillages. Weâ€™ve seen a lot AP issues caused by water damage (or coffee spillages) to the AP or cables.</p>

<h3>Don't put a cage around your AP.</h3>

<p>It can seem like a good idea to lock your AP away in a cage to secure it, you donâ€™t want anyone running off with your shiny new AP.</p>

<p>But putting your AP in a cage can cause major issues with your Wi-Fi signal, and will stop most of the Radio Frequency power outputted by it.</p>

<p>If possible, itâ€™s best to bolt your AP to a wall, a lot of APs now come with wall mounting accessories as standard.</p>

<h3> Don't install APs too close to each other.</h3>

<p>The more the merrier, right? Not always the case.</p>

<p>If you cram lots of APs into small areas or venues, you are going to have trouble with things like adjacent and co-channel interference, as well as aggressive roaming from one AP to another.</p>

<p>All of which add up to a poor user experience.</p>

<p>If you have a multiple AP deployment try to plan them in such a way that at any one point you donâ€™t see more than 3 APs. This is ideal, but understandably not always achievable.</p>
