I"<p>There are multiple layers to how your LEDE/OpenWRT device boots up. We are going to cover the general process of these, and which parts you can control yourself.</p>

<h2 id="bootloader">Bootloader</h2>

<p>The bootloader is the first process to execute on your device. It runs some low level hardware initialisation, then moves on to decompressing the kernal and running it in RAM.</p>

<h2 id="kernal">Kernal</h2>
<p>This section of the boot sets up various partitions in your device, laying out some of the file structure, and running any pre-initialisation processes. The mounting of specific partitions leads to the start of the init process.</p>

<h2 id="init">Init</h2>

<p>This is the section of the boot that you have some direct control over. Being able to add and remove processes that you want to initialise on boot. It run’s through it’s config files to find the processes it needs to start, and proceeds to execute them all to complete the boot process.</p>

<h2 id="enabling-processes-on-boot">Enabling Processes on Boot</h2>

<p>To add a process that starts on system boot, you will need to create a script file in /etc/init.d by running the following command:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>vi /etc/init.d/myscript
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And then creating a script like the example below:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c">#!/bin/sh /etc/rc.common</span>
<span class="c"># The order you want these scripts to be run.</span>
<span class="c"># e.g Start=6 will run after scripts with Start=5 but before Start=7</span>
<span class="nv">START</span><span class="o">=</span>6
<span class="nv">STOP</span><span class="o">=</span>12
<span class="c"># The command(s) you want to run on start</span>
start<span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>        
        <span class="nb">echo </span>starting
<span class="o">}</span>                 
<span class="c"># The command(s) you want to run on stop</span>
stop<span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>          
        <span class="nb">echo </span>stopping
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once you have your script added into the correct directory, it will need to be enabled by running the following command:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>/etc/init.d/myscript enable
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="disabling-process-on-boot">Disabling Process on Boot</h2>

<p>Just as easy as enabling a script, you just need to run the following command:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>/etc/init.d/myscript disable
</code></pre></div></div>
