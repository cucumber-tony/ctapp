I"g<p>The command arp-scan allows you to detect the MAC and IP addresses of devices connected within your network.</p>

<p>This guide will walk you through installing it and basic usage.</p>

<h2 id="ssh-to-your-openwrt-device">SSH to your OpenWRT device</h2>

<p>If you are using Windows then start PuTTY and click Session on the left side, select SSH from the options, and then enter in the IP Address of your OpenWRT box into the Host Name field.</p>

<p>Once youâ€™ve done this just click on Open to start up the SSH connection.</p>

</div>

<p>If you are connecting via terminal, then just SSH to your OpenWRT device using the following command, where 192.168.1.1 is your OpenWRT deviceâ€™s IP address.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ssh root@192.168.1.1
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

<p>Installing arp-scan takes no time at all, just simply run the following commands:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>opkg update
opkg install arp-scan
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

<p>Once you have it installed we can move on to usage. Just to note; there are shorthand variants of the commands we are going to use here, but for clarity we will be using the full versions.</p>

<p>An example of an arp-scan command is as follows:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>arp-scan --interface=eth0 --localnet
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now lets break down the individual sections:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">arp-scan</code> - This calls the command and runs arp-scan.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">--interface=eth0</code> - This defines the interface you are using for scanning. In this case we are using eth0.</p>

<p>The interfaces vary between device and operating system, as well as whether theyâ€™re wireless or not.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">--localnet</code> This tells arp-scan to scan all possible IP addresses on the network connected to the interface defined previously.</p>

<p>By running an arp-scan on a valid interface, you should get an output that contains information similar to the following:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>192.168.1.1     00:c0:xx:xx:xx:xx       Intel Corporation
192.168.1.2     00:c0:xx:xx:xx:xx       Intel Corporation
192.168.1.3     84:02:xx:xx:xx:xx       HTC Corporation
192.168.1.4     00:03:xx:xx:xx:xx       Compaq Computer Corporation
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>On the left you will see the IP address that device has on your local network, the deviceâ€™s MAC address is shown in the middle column, and itâ€™s manufacturer information is shown on the right hand side.</p>
