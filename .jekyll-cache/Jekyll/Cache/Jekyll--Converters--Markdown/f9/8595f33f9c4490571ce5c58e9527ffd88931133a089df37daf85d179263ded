I"N<p>A lot of people have asked what the difference is between the UniFi controller software and the CT WiFi interface.</p>

<p>We asked one avid user why he uses CT WiFi to manage his UniFi network. He said <em>“of course”</em> but asked to remain anonymous because <em>“if my competition got hold of CT Wi-Fi I’d loose my edge — it’s saves me hours of time and I don’t want them getting their hands on it.”</em></p>

<p>So we’re going to keep his identity secret, like he’s some sort of special MI5 agent. Let’s call him James.</p>

<p>###Hi James, so who what does your business use CT WiFi for?###</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>We’re an MSP (managed service provider). We have a network of around 40 UniFi APs installed in different customer sites. We do the whole bundle for them, POS, VoIP phones, PCs etc…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>###Why do you use CT WiFi?###</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>We use it to manage all our UniFi Wi-Fi APs. We used to use the UniFi software and run it in an Amazon cloud server. It didn’t give us much control over the network and managing and maintaining the network was a pain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>##<em>“With the UniFi software if I wanted to know the status of an access point I had to click into each one to check if it was online or offline. In CT WiFi I can see in a glance what’s happening…”</em>##</p>

  <p>With the UniFi software if I wanted to know the status of an access point I had to click into each one to check if it was online or offline. In Cucumber I can see in a glance what’s happening and if I need to do anything on the network.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>###And what made you look for a solution in the first place?###</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>We wanted a captive portal with splash pages to sell to our clients. CT WiFi has them so we started using these. Then we realised how much easier it was to run the Wi-Fi using the dashboard.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>###Anything else you’d like to add?###</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The extra functionality has really changed how we run the Wi-Fi networks in the office. We’re always talking about how great CT WiFi is — seriously.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ha, it’s always nice to hear we’ve made a difference. Thank you Sean, sorry I mean James. Damn well that’s your cover blown.</p>
