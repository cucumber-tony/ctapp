I"T<p><strong>Splash Page Timeout</strong>
<br /><br />
You can now set a timeout for your splash pages when using timed access. 
<br /><br />
This allows you to control the amount of time before the splash is seen again. For example, you set up two splash pages - clickthrough and vouchers. You want the clickthrough to appear for 2 hours per day. After which they need to use a voucher code.
<br /><br />
Set the timeout on the clickthrough splash to 90 days and, after their two hours has been used, they will only see the voucher page.
<br /><br />
