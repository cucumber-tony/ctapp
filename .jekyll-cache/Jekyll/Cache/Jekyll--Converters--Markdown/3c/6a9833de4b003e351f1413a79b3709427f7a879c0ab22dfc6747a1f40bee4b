</div>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Head into your <strong>Location</strong> on your dashboard.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Select <strong>SSIDs</strong> on the left sidebar, and click <strong>View</strong> on the SSID you want to have an external captive portal on.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Scroll down to the <strong>Captive Portal</strong> section, and the <strong>Advanced Settings</strong> header under that.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unselect <strong>Use CT WiFi Splash</strong> and you will see new fields appear.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can then change the <strong>Captive Portal URL</strong> field.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<hr />

<p>This can be useful in situations such as when using Google+ Social Logins with the default CT WiFi credentials.</p>

<p>In this situation, you will need to use the default splash URL to login, but you might have already branded your location previously.</p>

<p>This allows you to manually set the URL back to itâ€™s default.</p>

<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> In this case you should not make any changes to the <strong>Captive Portal UAM Secret</strong></em></p>
