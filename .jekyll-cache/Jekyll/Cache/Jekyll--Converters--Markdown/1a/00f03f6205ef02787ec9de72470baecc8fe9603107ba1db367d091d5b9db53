<p>To access the local portal, connect to the Access Point via one of itâ€™s SSIDs.</p>

<p>Then enter the interface IP of that SSID, which you can retrieve from your SSID list in CT WiFi.</p>

<p>If you arenâ€™t already logged in, it will prompt you for a username and password.</p>

<p>The username for the local portal is polkaspots.</p>

<p>Your password is the serial number of the box that you are trying to connect to, which you can locate through CT WiFi on the boxâ€™s information page as shown below.</p>
