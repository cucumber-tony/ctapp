<p>You have three ways to get your hands on a box.</p>

<h3>Option 1. Buy a box</h3>
<hr />

<p>If you don’t want to install the firmware yourself you can buy a box from us that already has the firmware installed. It will arrive in the post ready to plug in. No configuration required.</p>

<p>You can buy a box from within your account - <a href="https://my.ctapp.io/#/shop" class="dst">click here</a></p>

<h3>Option 2. Integrating via your radius settings (Meraki, Ruckus and more)</h3>
<hr />

<p>If you have a box that includes radius settings you can use the CT WiFi splash page and captive portal to manage your public Wi-Fi connection.</p>

<p>You don’t need to install firmware on your box, and can continue to use the control and management features of the vendor - e.g. the Meraki dashboard.</p>

<p>You will miss the management and reporting features in CT WiFi though - like how many users are connected and RF signal strength.</p>

<h3>Option 3. Downloading the firmware</h3>
<hr />

<p>Installing the CT WiFi firmware on your access point gives you full control of it. You’ll be able to utilise all the features available in your dashboard.</p>

<p>It’s simple to download the firmware on your access point. Just choose your access point and follow the instructions.</p>
