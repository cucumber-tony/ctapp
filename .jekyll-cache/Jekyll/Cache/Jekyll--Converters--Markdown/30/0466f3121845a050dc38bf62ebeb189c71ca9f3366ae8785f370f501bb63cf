<p>If you want to capture customer data, it‚Äôs simple with CT WiFi. It‚Äôs simple, here‚Äôs how it works:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The first time your customers try and get online, they‚Äôll see your registration form on the login page.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <blockquote>
      <p>After filling in the details, they will be logged in.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The next time they arrive, they won‚Äôt have to register again.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you have selected ‚ÄúRequire Registration‚Äù, they will need to enter a username and password when signing up. If you don‚Äôt select this, when they arrive again, they will just see a clickthrough login.</p>

<h2 id="step-1-create-a-splash-page">Step 1. Create a Splash Page</h2>

<p>In your Cucumber dashboard, create a new splash page (you can use an existing one if you want).</p>

<p>Make sure you‚Äôve set the access type to ‚ÄòRegistration‚Äô. Click the Edit Form button.</p>

<div class="mdl-typography--text-center">
  <img src="/images/community/tutorials/wifi-hotspot-registration-1.png" width="800px" />
</div>

<p>You should see a screen similar to this:</p>

<div class="mdl-typography--text-center">
  <img src="/images/community/tutorials/wifi-hotspot-registration-2.png" width="800px" />
</div>

<p>Enter a description for the form. This will appear on the login page.</p>

<h2 id="step-2-add-your-fields">Step 2. Add Your Fields</h2>

<p>Let‚Äôs create a country field. To do this, click the ‚ÄòAdd New‚Äô button on the right.</p>

<p>The options can be confusing to start with, we‚Äôll tell you what they mean here.</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="small-12 columns">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="small-12 medium-8 columns">
        <ul class="no-bullet">
          <li><b>Field Name</b>: this defines what it's called when you view your data. Make it descriptive, like 'gender' or 'country'.</li>
          <li><b>Field Label</b>: the label for the field and will appear on the logins. You can type 'hidden' here and it won't appear.</li>
          <li><b>Field Type</b>: the type of field, usually this will be text box.</li>
          <li><b>Required</b>: if you select this, your customers will have to enter something before they can login.</li>
          <li><b>Hidden</b>: Maybe you want to send a hidden variable with the request, for example an ID for your hotspot.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you click the advanced button, there's even more stuff.</p>

        <ul class="no-bullet">
          <li><b>Unique ID</b>: if you're on a paid account, you can sync your form with your MailChimp forms too. Enter your MailChimp merge name in here. For example, MMERGE4.</li>
          <li><b>Value</b>: you might want a default value for the field, particularly if you're using a hidden field.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="small-12 medium-4 columns">
        <img src="/images/community/tutorials/wifi-hotspot-registration-3.png" width="100%" />
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<h3 id="changing-the-order">Changing the order</h3>

<p>To change the order of the fields, simply drap them around!</p>

<div class="mdl-typography--text-center">
  <img src="/images/community/tutorials/registration-form-order.gif" width="400px" />
</div>

<h3 id="creating-radio-buttons">Creating Radio Buttons</h3>

<p>If you want some multiple-choice questions, you can use a checkbox but you‚Äôre better off with radio buttons. Set them up like this, it‚Äôs a blast!</p>

<div class="mdl-typography--text-center">
  <img src="/images/community/tutorials/reg-radio-buttons.gif" width="400px" />
</div>

<h3 id="getting-your-data">Getting your Data</h3>

<p>Once your customers have started signing-up, their data will appear in the guests report.</p>

<p>The default view shows all your records. If you want to see your custom fields, you can switch the splash page in the drop down menu.</p>

<p>In the guest‚Äôs page, you can view their details, usage history and leave some notes about the customer.</p>

<div class="mdl-typography--text-center">
  <img src="/images/community/tutorials/guest-lists.gif" width="400px" />
</div>

<h3 id="syncing-with-mailchimp-and-campaign-monitor">Syncing with MailChimp and Campaign Monitor</h3>

<p>To sync your emails with MailChimp, all you need to do is enable the newsletter in your splash page. Emails will automatically be sent to your service.</p>

<p>If you want to sync you custom fields with MailChimp, you need to be on a paid plan. If you‚Äôre on a paid plan, please make sure the ‚ÄòMerge Fieds‚Äô option is enabled. This only works with MailChimp at the moment.</p>

<div class="mdl-typography--text-center">

</div>

<h3 id="thats-a-wrap">That‚Äôs a Wrap</h3>

<p>You should be good to go, let us know if you need assistance with this!</p>

<h2 id="questions">Questions</h2>

<h3 id="what-if-they-turn-up-with-a-new-device">What if they turn up with a new device.</h3>

<p>If you‚Äôve selected ‚ÄúRequire Registration‚Äù, they will be able to sign-in with their chosen username and password.</p>

<p>If not, they will have to register again. There‚Äôs no way for us to tell who they are.</p>

<h3 id="i-cant-change-the-username">I can‚Äôt change the username</h3>

<p>That‚Äôs correct, the username field cannot be removed. The username is always the email of the customer.</p>

<h3 id="i-can-only-see-25-guests">I can only see 25 guests</h3>

<p>On the free plan, the number of guests you can view is limited to 25.</p>

<h3 id="i-dont-see-my-custom-fields-in-mailchimp">I don‚Äôt see my custom fields in MailChimp</h3>

<p>This option is only available for paid plan. If you‚Äôre on a paid plan, first check you have enabled ‚ÄúMerge Registration Fields‚Äù in your portal.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre sure you‚Äôve done this, check your field IDs match. Your fields ID are set in MailChimp. Your merge ID must match your Unique ID:</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="small-12 medium-6 columns">
    <img src="/images/community/tutorials/mailchimp-merge-fields.png" width="100%" />
  </div>
  <div class="small-12 medium-6 columns">
    <img src="/images/community/tutorials/mailchimp-merge-2.png" width="100%" />
  </div>
</div>

<h3 id="i-deleted-a-field-my-data-looks-wrong">I deleted a field, my data looks wrong.</h3>

<p>We recommend you don‚Äôt delete fields if you already have data. If you want to change some fields, it‚Äôs best to create a new splash page.</p>

<h3 id="can-i-export-the-data">Can I export the data</h3>

<p>You bet! Simply visit your reports page and hit the download button. You‚Äôll be able to download the data as a CSV. Please note, this is a paid feature.</p>
