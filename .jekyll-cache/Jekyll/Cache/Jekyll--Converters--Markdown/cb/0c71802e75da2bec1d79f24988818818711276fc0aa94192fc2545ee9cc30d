<h1>How N-Share Uses CT WiFi</h1>
<p>Rafael from N-share is building a database for his clients with a marketing platform. He uses CT's API integration to create the ideal platform for his business.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Whatâ€™s the Name of Your Company</h2>

<p>N-Share</p>

<h2>Whatâ€™s your name?</h2>

<p>Rafael Mesquita.</p>

<h2>Tell us a bit about your company</h2>

<p>Weâ€™re a digital marketing company based in Brazil. We use WiFi to gather information and offer guest access to the users. The users send information about themselves, receive coupons or even watch a video.</p>

<h2>How did you hear about CT WiFi?</h2>

<p>Through Google.</p>

<h2>What do you use CT WiFi for?</h2>

<p>As we have our own marketing and business intelligence platform, we use CT WiFi for the network management and use the splash pages. We use the API to integrate the platform with ours.</p>

<h2>And why were you looking for a solution like CT WiFi?</h2>

<p>In Brazil, the WiFi marketing business is blooming. Weâ€™re ahead of the competition and we were looking for a more affordable solution so we could offer our clients more than just Meraki, Aruba or Aerohive. We did find some other platforms but CT WiFi had the best hardware options.</p>

<h2>Whatâ€™s your favourite feature?</h2>

<p>We use the custom registration splash pages and itâ€™s great the end users donâ€™t need to complete the form again to sign in if theyâ€™ve been somewhere before.</p>

<h2>Anything else youâ€™d like to add?</h2>

<p>Keep up the good work!</p>


<p>Thatâ€™s what we like to hearâ€Šâ€”â€ŠCT WiFi integrating with other platforms. Thanks Rafael!Â :)</p>
