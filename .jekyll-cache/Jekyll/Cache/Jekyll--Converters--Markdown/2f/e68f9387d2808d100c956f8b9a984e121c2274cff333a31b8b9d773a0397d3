<h1>Interface Technical Training</h1>
<p>Mark Jacob, a Cisco instructor from Interface Technical Training uses CT for his business, but not how we expectedâ€¦</p>

<h2>Tell us a bit about your company</h2>

<p>Interface Technical Training offers a wide range of technical training for a range of solutions from Microsoft to Cisco and as well as various security systems.</p>

<h2>How did you hear about CT Networks?</h2>

<p>At the time, I was using Meraki to manage my MR12 device. It was easy to use but once my licence ran out, I lost the management ability. So I started looking for information on how to use my device on OpenWRT. After testing this, I also found CTâ€™s instructions and gave it a go.</p>

<h2>What do you use CT Networks for?</h2>

<p>Apart from being able to continue using my Meraki AP, the CT dashboard adds values to my networking classes. I use the dashboard to demo networking problems that could occur and how to resolve them.</p>

<h2>What's your favourite feature?</h2>

<p>I find the dashboard incredibly useful. To be able to manage, diagnose and resolve my networking issues over the cloud is very handy.</p>

<h2>Anything else youâ€™d like to add?</h2>

<p>Hereâ€™s a blog about my experienceâ€Šâ€”â€Š<a href="https://www.interfacett.com/blogs/openwrt-cucumber-meraki-access-point/" target="_blank">transforming a Meraki AP into a CT AP</a>.</p>
