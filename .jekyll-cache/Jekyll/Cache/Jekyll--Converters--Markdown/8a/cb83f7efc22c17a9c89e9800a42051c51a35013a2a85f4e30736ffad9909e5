<h1>How Trident Group Use CT WiFi</h1>
<p>Trident have a Ruckus Virtual Smart Zone network and use CT WiFi to manage it. David tells us why they use CT WiFi alongside their Ruckus vSZ.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Hi David, so who are Trident?</h2>

<p>We‚Äôre a professional infrastructure company. We provide managed services to all kinds of businesses. Wi-Fi management is one of the services we offer.</p>

<h2>What do you use CT WiFi for?</h2>

<p>We have a big Ruckus network which we run using the Virtual Smart Zone (vSZ). We use the CT WiFi management interface to monitor and control the vSZ and the offer clients captive portal solutions. A lot of our clients are hospitality based and need a splash page and captive portal.</p>

<p>We manage the whole Wi-Fi solution for them, the captive portal is just part of the offering. CT WiFi means we can offer a great monitoring and management service.</p>

<p>Having a CT WiFi dashboard means we can manage different vendor access points. We‚Äôre looking at some APs we can install the CT WiFi firmware on. The Ubiquity UniFi for example would suit some clients on a lower budget who don‚Äôt need high end kit like Ruckus or Meraki. This way we could offer clients a bigger range of solutions and one to match any budget.</p>

<div class="mdl-typography--text-center">
<h4>‚ÄúOur favourite thing is the simple interface. The Ruckus vSZ is complex, the CT WiFi dashboard helps make it such a better user experience.‚Äù</h4>

<h2>What were you looking to solve with CT WiFi?</h2>

<p>We originally thought the vSZ had a captive portal solution, so when we found out it didn‚Äôt we looked for a third party option. It was too labour intensive to create and maintain one ourselves.</p>

<p>We looked around the market, our Ruckus distributor recommended we try Purple Wi-Fi, but it was expensive and the tech wasn‚Äôt quite there. CT WiFi was the best on price and tech.</p>

<p>When we first got in touch the guys at CT WiFi were so friendly‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit was a breath of fresh air how they dealt with our set up. We could speak to the techies directly and they‚Äôd set things up and changed configs for us there and then.</p>

<h2>Do you have a favourite feature?</h2>

<p>One of our favourite things is the easy interface. The Ruckus interface is complex and the CT WiFi dashboard helps improve this experience. We‚Äôre looking forward to getting more control out of this.</p>

<p>What we really love though is the CT WiFi team. Their support has been great. It‚Äôs important for us to be able to speak to someone who knows the product inside out‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääsomeone we know and trust to sort things out. We‚Äôre servicing clients so if we need help we can‚Äôt wait days for a response.</p>
