<p>To set up an EnGenius box, here’s what you’ll need:</p>

<ul>
<li>A computer with ethernet ports</li>
<li>An Engenius access point and power supply</li>
<li>1 x Ethernet cable</li>
<li>A download of the PolkaSpoSts firmware</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>Plug in your power supply and connect it to your EnGenius. This will turn the box on.</p>

<p>Next, connect one end of the Ethernet cable to the <b>LAN</b> port of your <b>EnGenius</b>, and the other end of it to a <b>LAN port</b> on your <b>modem</b>.</p>

<p>Open up your web browser and navigate to <b>192.168.0.1</b> to open the <b>Local Portal</b> of the EnGenius box.</p>

<p>If it’s a new box, click on <b>Network Setting</b> to go into the settings of your box. If not, then skip to the next step.</p>

</div>

<p>Once you have access to the local portal, click on the <b>cog symbol</b> at the top right of the page, which will open the settings.</p>

</div>

<p>Next, on the left sidebar click on <b>Tools</b> to expand it, and then click on <b>Firmware</b>, which will open the Firmware page.</p>

</div>

<p>Click on <b>Choose File</b> and select the Stinky Panda firmware you downloaded in preparation from CT WiFi, and click <b>Apply</b>.</p>

</div>

<p>Your access point will now validate the firmware and install it.</p>

<p>During this installation time, a countdown will be displayed, but it will not accurately tell how much time is left, as half way through the stock firmware will be replaced with ours.</p>

<p>Because of this, the countdown will not actually end, and you will not get any Engenius notification that the firmware was a success.</p>

<p>Please wait 5 or so minutes, and you will know that the firmware install has been successful when you can see <b><strong>Private Wi-Fi</strong></b> being broadcasted. <b><i>(You do not need to connect to this SSID).</i></b></p>

<h2>Your box is now ready to be added into CT WiFi!</h2>
