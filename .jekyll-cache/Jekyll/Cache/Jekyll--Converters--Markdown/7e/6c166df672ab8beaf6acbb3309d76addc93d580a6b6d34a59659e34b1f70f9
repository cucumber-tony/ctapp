I"¥<h2>Why have a splash page?</h2>

<p>Your splash page is the gateway to your Wi-Fi hotspot. Itâ€™s part of the captive portal that authenticates users (checks that theyâ€™re allowed to use your Wi-Fi) and keeps your hotspot secure and legally compliant.</p>

<p>Every guest to your Wi-Fi hotspot sees this page before they access the Internet; first impressions are everything.</p>

<p>So, as well as a bit of security, itâ€™s an opportunity to talk to your WiFi users. A simple welcome message waves a nice â€˜helloâ€™ to everyone.</p>

<h2>Designing your splash page</h2>

<h3>Keep it simple</h3>

<p>The main purpose of the splash page is to let your guests connect to your Wi-Fi, so this should be your main focus.</p>

<p>Keep the login method nice and clear. Too much extra content and itâ€™ll end up looking like a webpage and confuse your guests.</p>

<p>If you want to offer more content, use a second page or redirect users to a web page once theyâ€™ve connected to the Internets.</p>

<h3>Make it responsive</h3>

</div>

<p>This is an example of a non-responsive splash page. You do not want this.</p>

<p>The vast majority of hotspot users are from mobile devices, so it is important that your splash page works well with these devices.</p>

<p>When your guests have to zoom into a tiny form field to enter their details and connect, itâ€™s a right faff. A page thatâ€™s optimised for mobile will be pared down to fit the page perfectly, making it 100% fat finger proof.</p>
