<h1>F1 Consultancy Integrates Xirrus with CT WiFi</h1>
<p>The F1 Consultancy team were looking for guest access integration for events with thousands of users. They chose CT WIFi to ensure everything would run seamlessly. Here’s what Mark had to say.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Tell us a bit about your company</h2>

<p>F1 Consultancy specialise in setting up large scale, temporary wireless networks for events, conferences and exhibitions. We support a number of high profile clients and events, large and small, all over the world. We pride ourselves in delivering exceptional quality of service and user experience throughout any event and it is very important to us that every event that we support is a success.</p>

<h2>How did you hear about CT WiFi?</h2>

<p>Through a colleague.</p>

<h2>What do you use CT WiFi for?</h2>

<p>Offering a splash page solution for advertising and branding, when attendees connect to the network at an event.</p>

<h2>And why were you looking for a solution like CT WiFi?</h2>

<p>We were asked by our client whether we could implement a splash page within our network so that this could be offered as a branding opportunity to potential sponsors of the event.</p>

<h2>What’s your favourite feature?</h2>

<p>The ease of customisation of the page within the portal is great. This also scales on various devices very well, compared to other solutions we have tried.</p>

<h2>Anything else you’d like to add?</h2>

<p>I’d like to thank the team, who worked tirelessly in ensuring the solution worked well with our kit in time for the event.</p>

<p>Thanks Mark! It’s been a blast working with your team. We look forward to working with you for future events :)</p>
