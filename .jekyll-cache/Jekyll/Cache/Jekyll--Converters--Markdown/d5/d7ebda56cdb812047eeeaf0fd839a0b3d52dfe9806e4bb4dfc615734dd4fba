<h3>What is Tiered Logins?</h3>
</div>

<p>Tiered Logins will allow you to achieve setups such as having a splash page with 1 hour free WiFi, and once that has run out they can get a new splash page with paid voucher access.</p>

<p>To set up Tiered Logins on your SSID you will need to first create the different splash pages you want the users to see, and the access restrictions that you want applied to them.</p>

<p>Once you have done this, you will need to adjust the weights of the splash pages.</p>

<p>The highest weight will be the splash that is displayed first.</p>
