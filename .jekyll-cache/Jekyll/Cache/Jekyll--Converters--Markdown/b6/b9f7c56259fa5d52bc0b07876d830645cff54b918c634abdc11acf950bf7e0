<p>Once you are logged into your OpenWRT device, run the following command to edit your wireless config file by running the following command:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">vi /etc/config/wireless</code></p>

<p>You will want to add the following option to your wireless config:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">option isolate 1</code></p>

<p>For the wireless config that you want to enable isolation on, add that option in. It should look something like the following:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>config 'wifi-iface'
        option 'device'     'wl0'
        option 'network'    'lan'
        option 'mode'       'ap'
        option 'ssid'       'MyWifiAP'
        option 'encryption' 'psk2'
        option 'key'        'secret passphrase'
        option 'isolate'    '1'
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After saving your change, run the following command to restart your wireless interfaces and apply the change:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">wifi</code></p>
