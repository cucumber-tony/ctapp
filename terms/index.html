      <h2>Terms</h2>
      <h4>Effective: November 2017</h4>
      <p>Before you register with CT WiFi, you must read and agree to this Terms of Service ("TOS"). By using the CT WiFi services (the "Service"), you agree to be bound by the TOS and you agree that it is enforceable as if it were a written negotiated agreement signed by CT WiFi and you.</p>
      <p>This TOS, is an agreement you must accept in order to use CT WiFi's Service (as defined below). It is applicable to (a) "Owners" -- this includes Primary Owners who initially set up the Service and other Owners that are granted ownership privileges by the Primary Owner; (b) Administrators – those who manage and run a team, channel, or group ("Administrators") (Owners and Administrators, collectively "Administrative Users"), and to c) Members – users who are invited to join an existing team that has already been created in the Service by an Administrator ("Members”). The terms "you" and "users" encompass all users, including both Administrative Users and Members. This document describes both your rights and your obligations as part of using the Service. It is important that you read it carefully because you will be legally bound to these terms. CT WiFi only provides its Service (as defined below) to you subject to this TOS. By accepting this TOS or by accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by this TOS (including the Privacy Policy, which is incorporated here by reference).</p>
      <p>If you are entering into this TOS on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity, its Members, its Administrative Users, and its affiliates to this TOS. In that case, the terms "you" or "your" shall also refer to such entity, its Members, its Administrative Users, and its affiliates, as applicable. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with this TOS, you may not use the Service. You acknowledge that this TOS is a contract between you and CT WiFi, even though it is electronic and is not physically signed by you and CT WiFi, and it governs your use of the Service.</p>
      <p>CT WiFi is designed for you to have one account to manage your network. You must not abuse the TOS by creating multiple accounts. If you or your administrators are creating multiple accounts, you will be violating the TOS and your account may be disabled. Upon signing up for a Free plan, your splash view limit will be restricted to 50. We will enable the splash views on your account once you have verified your business.</p>
      <p>CT WiFi may, in its sole discretion, modify or revise the TOS and subscriptions at any time without notice to you, and you agree to be bound by such modifications or revisions. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features that augment or enhance the current Service shall be subject to the TOS. Continued use of the Service after any such changes shall constitute your consent to such changes. You can review the most current version of the TOS at any time at: http://www.ct-networks.io/terms</p>
