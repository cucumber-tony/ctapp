<h1>How RDS Global Use CT WiFi</h1>
<p>Nigel from RDS Global tells us why they use CT WiFi to manage wireless networks, and how it’s improved their clients’ ROI.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Hi Nigel, so who are RDS Global?</h2>

<p>We’re an IT service provider. We partner with all kinds of businesses, from local SME’s to government departments and retail stores. We don’t just consult on Wi-Fi, we do a full range of managed IT services.</p>

<h2>How have you set your network up using CT WiFi?</h2>

<p>We use it to deploy Wi-Fi networks for clients — both guest and internal.</p>

<p>Before we used CT WiFi we deployed bespoke solutions into different networks. We would often encounter situations where their current guest access sat on the business LAN. This wasn’t ideal for security and performance of business critical applications and everything was managed manually or not at all. It didn’t feel professional.</p>

<p>CT WiFi gives us a unified solution, a fit all, tick box, point and shoot deployment with control over the network and a front end that we can present to customers.</p>

<p>Because the system makes it easy to separate guest and business internal traffic on the VLAN we can install one unified system. Previously clients had to purchase two networks and multiple access points for business and customer Wi-Fi. Now this can be done under one umbrella, giving customers a much better ROI. It also makes it easier for us to provide a professional and affordable network. We can do everything from filtering customer content and shaping traffic to creating a professional front end splash screen to improve their customer experience.</p>

<h2>What’s your favourite feature?</h2>

<p>It just ticks all the boxes. I’ve now got one platform that covers everything a client could ask for, from backend network security to a captive portal with email capture. I mock up a splash page for a client and the system sells itself from there.</p>

<p>For me it’s gives me the confidence to install a network I know will work.</p>
