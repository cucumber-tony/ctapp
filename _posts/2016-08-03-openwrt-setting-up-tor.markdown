This guide will run you through the steps needed to get Tor working with your LEDE/OpenWRT device to help protect your personal privacy on the internet.

## SSH to your OpenWRT device

If you are using Windows then start PuTTY and click Session on the left side, select SSH from the options, and then enter in the IP Address of your OpenWRT box into the Host Name field.

Once you’ve done this just click on Open to start up the SSH connection.

If you are connecting via terminal, then just SSH to your OpenWRT device using the following command, where 192.168.1.1 is your OpenWRT device’s IP address.

    ssh root@192.168.1.1

## Network Configuration

To start off we want to get your device set up and running all the correct network and firewall rules in preparation for configuring Tor.

First off we need to define a new network interface, so run the following command:

    vi /etc/config/network

Now we will need to add in something similar to the following:

    config interface ‘wifi’
    option proto ‘static’
    option ipaddr ‘192.168.10.1’
    option netmask ‘255.255.255.0’

Next we need to define this interface’s DHCP pool, so run the following:

    vi /etc/config/dhcp

And then add in the following:

    config dhcp ‘wifi’
    option interface ‘wifi’
    option start ‘100’
    option limit ‘150’
    option leasetime ‘12h’

Now we need to create a new firewall zone so we can configure the specific rules needed. Run the following command:

    vi /etc/config/firewall
Then add in the following:

    config zone
    option name ‘wifi’
    option input ‘ACCEPT’
    option output ‘ACCEPT’
    option forward ‘REJECT’
    option network ‘wifi’
    config forwarding
    option src ‘wifi’
    option dest ‘wan’
    config forwarding
    option src ‘wan’
    option dest ‘wifi’

After that, we need to define the wireless, so run the following:

    vi /etc/config/wireless

And add in the following, making sure to tweak the necessary fields to match your setup.

    config wifi-device ‘radio0’
    option type ‘mac80211’
    option hwmode ‘11g’
    option path ‘platform/ar933x_wmac’
    option htmode ‘HT20’
    option channel ‘1’
    option country ‘IN’
    option txpower ‘20’
    config wifi-iface
    option device ‘radio0’
    option ssid ‘My Awesome WiFi’
    option mode ‘ap’
    option network ‘wifi’
    option disabled ‘0’
    option encryption ‘psk2’
    option key ‘SuperSecretPassword’

Finally run the following commands to restart all the necessary processes:

    ifup wifi
    /etc/init.d/dnsmasq restart
    /etc/init.d/network restart

## Firewall Rules

We are going to add the firewall rules into the firewall user file, so run the following command:

    vi /etc/firewall.user

Then add in the following lines:

    tor_rules() {
    iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i wlan0 -p tcp — dport 22 -j REDIRECT — to-ports 22
    iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i wlan0 -p tcp — dport 9050 -j REDIRECT — to-ports 9050
    iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i wlan0 -p udp — dport 53 -j REDIRECT — to-ports 9053
    iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i wlan0 -p tcp — syn -j REDIRECT — to-ports 9040
    }
    tor_rules

Finally restart the firewall to apply your changes:

/etc/init.d/firewall restart

## Configuring Tor

Now that the LEDE/OpenWRT network settings have been configured correctly, we can install and configure Tor.

To install Tor, run the following commands:

    opkg update
    opkg install tor tor-geoip

Now we just need to edit the Tor config file, so run the following:

    vi /etc/tor/torrc

And add in the following, making sure to tweak the necessary fields for your setup:

    DataDirectory /var/lib/tor
    AllowUnverifiedNodes middle,rendezvous
    VirtualAddrNetworkIPv4 10.192.0.0/11
    AutomapHostsSuffixes .onion,.exit
    AutomapHostsOnResolve 1
    TransPort 9040
    TransListenAddress 192.168.10.1
    DNSPort 9053
    DNSListenAddress 192.168.10.1
    SocksPort 9050
    SocksBindAddress 192.168.10.1:9050
    SocksBindAddress 192.168.10.1:9050

Finally, to confirm whether you have set everything up correctly and working, connect to the new network and navigate to the following site in a browser:
https://check.torproject.org/

If you have configured everything correctly, you should get a success message displayed.
Enjoy your newfound privacy on the internet!
