<h1>Using CT WiFi To Manage UniFi</h1>
<p>We asked one avid user why he uses CT WiFi to manage his Ubiquiti UniFi network. He asked that he remained anonymous to avoid revealing any information to his competition. He said: </p>

<div class="mdl-typography--text-center">
<h4>“...if my competition got hold of CT WiFi I’d loose my edge — it’s saves me hours of time, I don’t want them getting their hands on it.”</h4>

<h2>What does your business use CT WiFi for?</h2>

<p>We’re an MSP (managed service provider). We have a network of around 40 UniFi APs installed in different customer sites. We do the whole bundle for them, POS, VoIP phones, PCs etc...</p>

<h2>Why do you use CT WiFi?</h2>

<p>We use CT WiFi to manage all our UniFi APs. We used to run the UniFi software in an Amazon cloud server. Maintaining the network was a pain and we didn’t have much control. I had to click into each access point individually to see which one was online. With CT WiFi I can see in a glance what’s happening.</p>

<h2>What problem does CT WiFi fix for you?</h2>

<p>To start we wanted a captive portal with splash pages to sell to our clients. CT WiFi has them so we started using these. Then we realised how much easier it was to run the Wi-Fi using the dashboard so we now use it daily to run our networks.</p>

<h2>Anything else you’d like to add?</h2>

<p>The extra functionality has really changed how we run the Wi-Fi networks in the office. We’re always talking about how great CT WiFi is — seriously.</p>
