<h1>CT WiFi - A Vital Solution</h1>
<p>Today we hear from Lee Evans, MD of Vital Technology Group and their experience with CT WiFi.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Tell us a bit about your company</h2>

<p>We’re a multi disciplinary technology service provider.</p>
<p>One of our core offerings is around Managed IT Services — we specify, install and maintain IT systems for businesses, ranging from traditional server solutions to cloud, wireless, backup & DR and security.</p>

<h2>How did you hear about CT WiFi?</h2>

<p>From our distributor — MSDist</p>

<h2>What do you use CT WiFi for?</h2>

<p>We use it to provide consolidated management of wireless infrastructure across our client base.</p>

<p>It not only provides us with a great, centralised place to manage all of our client environments but also benefits our clients by removing the need for on-site controllers and providing advanced functionality such as social login and effective captive portal facilities.</p>

<h2>And why were you looking for a solution like CT WiFi?</h2>

<p>We had limitations with our previous solutions Power Cloud. Development was slow, with new features and improvements few and far between.</p>

<p>This is also a single hardware based product which was restricting our ability to meet an increasingly diverse range of environmental requirements.</p>

<h2>What’s your favourite feature?</h2>

<p>To be able to automatically rotate guest WiFi passwords and let the relevant people know — with our old solution these often weren’t changed frequently enough, so CT WiFi has helped us to improve security of our client networks.</p>

<h2>Lastly, is there anything else you’d like to add?</h2>

<p>So far, we’re very happy with the solution. It’s not been too long since we started using CT WiFi but looks like all is going well.</p>

<p>Thanks for the feedback Lee, we’ve enjoyed working with Vital so far and your feature requests will help us improve CT WiFi for everyone.</p>
