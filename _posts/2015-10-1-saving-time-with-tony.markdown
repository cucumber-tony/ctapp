##How CT WiFi Saves Vospers Motors Hours of IT Management Time.

Jonathan is the IT guy at Vospers motors. He has been using CT WiFi since day one. In this blog he tells us why his network is still growing and how it's changed things for the better at Vospers.

###Who are Vospers and what do you do?

>We're the largest motor dealer in the South West of England. We cover all motor brands across 18 showrooms and we're adding new sites regularly.

###And what do you use CT WiFi for?

>To start we used it to manage the customer WiFi networks in all the showrooms. We created splash pages and a captive portal and monitored the network. Now we're using it to manage the corporate and guest WiFi.

##"I can't think of one thing I liked in Meraki that I didn't get in CT WiFi for a fraction of the price.”

###What do you like about CT WiFi?

>Having one pane of glass for all our wireless networks. Now we can create new network SSIDs and passwords across the whole estate in a few clicks. It saves the team a lot of hours setting up and diagnosing issues. If a user has a problem connecting I can quickly check the network status to see if it's a problem with the WiFi or their device.

###What do you love about CT WiFi?

>The support. It's by far the best support I've had from a company. The development of the platform has been immense. I can chat to someone who knows their stuff in a few minutes. You can see the transformation from a few years back, and all through that process the team have been there making changes and fixes as soon as you mention them.

###Anything else you'd like to add?

>It gives us everything we need for a lot less than a wireless network from someone like Aruba or Meraki. We tested these alongside CT WiFi and they were impressive, but I can't think of one thing I liked in Meraki that I didn't get in CT WiFi for a fraction of the price. In comparison the CT WiFi platform is simpler solution which makes it so quick and easy to manage. Since installing CT WiFi I've had enough spare time to work on my paper aeroplanes, I'm the current team leader…
