It’s a good idea to get the best internet connection you can afford whether it’s fibre, cable, ADSL or satellite.

Here are some things to think about before you sign up for a contract with an ISP.

###How fast will your connection be?

Speed is normally measured in mega bytes per second (Mbps). It’s often referred to as your bandwidth e.g. how much bandwidth you have determines how fast the internet will go.

The speed you get is determined by the service you buy and what’s available in your local area.

###What’s my local area got to do with it?

You may have seen boxes like this hanging around on street corners.

<div class="text-center">

These are exchange points. They’re full of wires like this.

Cable runs from your property to a point like this. The further away your building is the longer the cable connecting you. The longer the cable the slower the internet.

Not all exchange points are made equal some will only operate certain services. You can check your distance to the exchange and which ISPs operate in your area using the SamKnows website.

###The Difference Between FTTC and ADSL Broadband

The most important thing to know is FTTC is faster than ADSL.

FTTC stands for Fibre to the Cabinet. That’s a fibre cable running into the exchange cabinet (image above) and copper cable running the final distance from the cabinet to your building.
Fibre optic cable transmits data much faster than copper cable.

ADSL or ADSL 2+ uses the copper infrastructure.

As the UK cable network has been around for a long time, most of it is made up of copper cables. The network is slowly being upgraded but it will take time.

A dedicated fibre network will give you a lot more bandwidth which you won’t have to share with your neighbours. This costs significantly more than an FTTC or ADSL service but if you’re running a business network and expecting more than 20 people to use your Wi-Fi at the same time it’s a worthwhile investment.

###People Eat Bandwidth, and so Does Video…

Every person using your internet will take up bandwidth. Say you have 5MB bandwidth, and 5 people on the internet, that 5 MB will be shared between 5 people.

The activity people do also makes a difference. For example streaming video takes up more bandwidth than browsing email.

When you sign up to an internet service you need to make sure it’s going to give you enough juice to support everyone connected and the kind of activity they’re going to do.
