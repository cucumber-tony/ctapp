The Ruckus virtual smartzone gateway integration went live a few weeks back so we spoke to Trident Group who were one of the first to start using it to see how things are working out.

###Hey David, first up can you tell us a bit about Trident and what you guys do?

>We're a professional infrastructure company. We provide managed services to all kinds of businesses. WiFi management is one of the services we offer.

###And what do you use CT WiFi for?

>We use the captive portal solution for our Ruckus vSZ. A lot of our clients are hospitality based and need a splash page and captive portal to offer their customers WiFi. We provide them with a fully managed WiFi solution, the captive portal is just part of the offering.

>It's early days but we're looking at some of CT's APs as well. The UniFi for example would suit some clients on a lower budget who don't need high end kit like Ruckus or Meraki. This way we could manage a mix of vendors from one dashboard.

###How did you find CT WiFi? And what made you look for something in the first place?

>We originally thought the vSZ had a captive portal solution, so when we found it didn't we looked for a third party option. It was too labour intensive to create and maintain one ourselves.

>We looked around the market, our Ruckus distributor recommended we try Purple WiFi, but it was expensive and the tech wasn't quite there. CT was the best on price and tech.
The guys at CT were so friendly — it was a breath of fresh air how they dealt with our set up. We could speak to the techies directly and they set things up and changed configs. for us there and then.

###How did you set up your network using CT WiFi?

>We were looking for a solution for our Ruckus network — it's a big network so we have a vSZ. CT integrates with this so we can see an overview of performance in the CT WiFi dashboard and use the captive portal and splash page designer. We can now roll it out across our client base as and when we need. It's super easy now we're set up.

###What's your favourite feature? Any features you wish it had?

>One of our favourite things is the easy interface. The Ruckus interface is complex and the CT WiFi dashboard helps improve this experience. We're looking forward to getting more control out of this.

>What we really love though is the CT team. Their support has been great. It's important for us to be able to speak to someone who knows the product inside out — someone we know and trust to sort things out. We're servicing clients so if we need help we can't wait days for a response.

###Anything else you'd like to add?

>It just rocks…

**Thanks David. You rock as well.**
