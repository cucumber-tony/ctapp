1. Head into your **Location** on your dashboard.

2. Select **SSIDs** on the left sidebar, and click **View** on the SSID you want to have an external captive portal on.

2. Scroll down to the **Captive Portal** section, and the **Advanced Settings** header under that.

3. Unselect **Use CT WiFi Splash** and you will see new fields appear.

4. You can then change the **Captive Portal URL** field.

This can be useful in situations such as when using Google+ Social Logins with the default CT WiFi credentials.

In this situation, you will need to use the default splash URL to login, but you might have already branded your location previously.

This allows you to manually set the URL back to it's default.

_**Note:** In this case you should not make any changes to the **Captive Portal UAM Secret**_
