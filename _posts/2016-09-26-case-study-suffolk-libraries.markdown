<h1>How Suffolk Libraries Use CT WiFi</h1>
<p>Suffolk Libraries has been a customer for many years. Today they share their story in hopes others who have a similar network can learn from their experience.</p>

<h2>What’s the Name of Your Company</h2>

<p>Suffolk Libraries</p>

<h2>Tell us a bit about your company</h2>

<p>We’re a not for profit, independent and charitable organisation set up in August 2012 to run the service for the benefit of the people of Suffolk. All libraries in Suffolk are run by Suffolk Libraries. We’re contracted by Suffolk County Council to run the service.</p>

<h2>How did you hear about CT WiFi?</h2>

<p>We’re also a <a href="http://www.polkaspots.com/">PolkaSpots</a> customer. At the time we were looking for a centralised WiFi management solution and found CT WiFi to be a handy tool to work with.</p>

<h2>What do you use CT WiFi for?</h2>

<p>We use CT WiFi to manage WiFi connectivity for all libraries in Suffolk.</p>

<h2>And why were you looking for a solution like CT WiFi?</h2>

<p>To manage multiple sites in one place. A lot of libraries in Suffolk are very far away. Some take an hour’s drive to get there. Being able to remotely check the issue saves us a lot of time.</p>

<h2>What’s your favourite feature?</h2>

<p>The chat feature is great. It’s much easier to find in the new platform and the response time is immediate. Where some of the libraries are located, they don’t always have phone signal. Being able to chat to someone and get our problems resolved quickly is very helpful.</p>

<h2>Anything else you’d like to add?</h2>

<p>I like the new CT WiFi layout. The flatness and design makes it easy to navigate and find things in the dashboard.</p>

<p>Thanks Steph! We’re glad to hear CT WiFi has helped make managing your sites easier.</p>
