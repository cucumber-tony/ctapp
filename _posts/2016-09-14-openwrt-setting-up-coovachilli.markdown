CoovaChilli is a handy package that allows you to set up a captive portal splash page on your LEDE/OpenWRT device.

This guide assumes you already have a RADIUS set up, or are using a splash page provider, with the details needed.

## SSH to your OpenWRT device

If you are using Windows then start PuTTY and click Session on the left side, select SSH from the options, and then enter in the IP Address of your OpenWRT box into the Host Name field.

Once you’ve done this just click on Open to start up the SSH connection.

If you are connecting via terminal, then just SSH to your OpenWRT device using the following command, where 192.168.1.1 is your OpenWRT device’s IP address.

    ssh root@192.168.1.1

## Installation

Installation is as simple as running the following two commands:

    opkg update
    opkg install coova-chilli

## Configuration

Before making changes to your config, it’s safest to stop Chilli for now. Run the following:

    /etc/init.d/chilli stop /etc/init.d/chilli disable

Next we need to actually make some changes to the configuration. To do this, run the following command:

    vi /etc/config/chilli

You will need to edit the config file using your details:

    config chilli
    # option disabled 1
    # RADIUS account details
    option radiusnasid   "xxxxxxxxx"
    option radiussecret  "xxxxxxxxx"
    option uamsecret  "xxxxxxxxx"
    # WISPr settings
    option locationname   "<human readible location name>"
    option radiuslocationname  "<SSID>,<sub-ID>"
    option radiuslocationid  "isocc=<cc>,cc=<idd>,ac=<ac>,network=<SSID>"
    # Radius parameters
    option radiusserver1  radius.domain.com
    option radiusserver2  radius2.domain.com
    # LAN interface to put the hotspot
    option dhcpif    br-lan
    # DNS
    option dns1   8.8.8.8
    option dns2   8.8.4.4
    # Tunnel and Subnet
    option tundev    'tun0'
    option net   192.168.180.0/22
    option uamlisten  192.168.182.1
    option lease   86400
    option leaseplus  600
    # UAM parameters
    option uamserver  "https://domain.com/directory/file.php"
    option uamuiport   4990
    option uamanydns  1
    #option uamaliasip   1.0.0.1
    option uamaliasname   login
    #option uamlogoutip   1.0.0.0
    option nouamsuccess  1
    # Hosts walled garden
    option uamallowed "host.com"
    # Domains walled garden
    option uamdomain ".domain1.com,.domain2.com"
    # Debug
    option swapoctets  1
    option interval   3600
    # Chilli firewall rules
    option ipup '/etc/chilli/up.sh'
    option ipdown '/etc/chilli/down.sh'

Next confirm that the interface defined under Tunnel and Subnet in the config is up:

    ifconfig

Finally, to confirm that everything is working, connect to your hotspot.
