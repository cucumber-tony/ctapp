<h1>The Devolo-CT Partnership</h1>
<p>Thomas, lead engineer of Devolo AG shares their journey of working with CT WiFi and why they chose this software solution.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Tell us a bit about your company</h2>

<p>Since 2002, Devolo AG has been developing innovative Powerline and data communications products for private customers and professional users. We use it to connect not only the networked world at home, in businesses and in the smart grid, but above all — people. Our goal is to make the complex world of data communication more simple. With this claim, we are developing future-oriented products and solutions together.</p>

<h2>How did you hear about CT WiFi?</h2>

<p>I alway watch the OpenWRT summit videos, and during the Lightning Talks Simon talked about CT WiFi and what it can do. I was really impressed with what they’d built and the approach they had to the management system.</p>

<h2>What do you use CT WiFi for?</h2>

<p>With our hardware expertise, we partnered with CT WiFi to use their platform in order to provide our customers with a solution and hence managed services.</p>

<h2>And why were you looking for a solution like CT WiFi?</h2>

<p>We wanted to provide our users with a software that provides them with a range of solutions and services. However we knew investing time into building the software for our devices would take a long time. So we were looking for a software solution that would include all necessary functionalities, and would be eager to improve the platform according to new requirements, and of course allow us to accelerate our product launch.</p>

<h2>What made you choose CT WiFi?</h2>

<p>We like the fresh vibe that CT WiFi brings to the table. The fact they take feedback, have an open discussion and act on things in a really fast manner, makes this collaboration a truly productive partnership. Also we a very fond of the reporting and monitoring functionalities.</p>

<h2>Anything else you’d like to add?</h2>

<p>Keep the innovation and development going. We’re really excited about what’s to come.</p>

<p>Thanks Thomas, it has been an exciting challenge working with the Devolo team. We look forward to the exciting ventures to come!</p>
