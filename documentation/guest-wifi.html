    <p>To set yourself up a public network for your guests, head into your location in Cucumber Tony</p>
    <p>Select SSIDs on the left hand sidebar, and then click on Create Network. This will open up some new fields for you to populate. Give your new SSID a name, and then select Open and Splash Page from the options below.</p>
    <p>Now click on Splash Pages on the left hand side, and click on the Edit button under your newly created splash page.</p>
    <p>From here, you can change your primary access type by selecting an option from the drop down menu. For the most basic option select Clickthrough and save your changes.</p>
    <p>There are a number of other more advanced options here that will be covered in later sections.</p>
