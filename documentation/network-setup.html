    <p>To get started with Cucumber Tony, head over to www.ctapp.io. Once here, enter your email address into the field and click on Go.</p>
    <p>You'll be sent a registration link by email, simply open it up and click on the link, which will start you on your account creation in Cucumber Tony.</p>
    <p>Clicking the link will bring you to a page where you will need to set your company/location name, and then enter in a postal address and click Next.</p>
    <p>The next step is to set up a custom brand. Your customer brand will be used to create a custom URL for you. Don't worry if you've given it a silly name, you can change this later.</p>
    <p>Now give yourself a name and a secure password for your account and click Next.</p>
    <p>This completes the sign up process. You'll now be taken to your account dashboard. As you've just added some details, Cucumber Tony has taken this and created a location for you. To customise and view your location, simply click on Customise your location.</p>
