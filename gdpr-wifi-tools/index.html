          <h3>Get Consent With GDPR Friendly Splash Pages</h3>
          <p>Even if you're not using the built-in email capture, you're capturing personal data in the form of IP & MAC addresses. The GDPR says that you must obtain explicit, opt-in consent, and be clear about how your customer data will be used.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>GDPR friendly splash pages that are fast to set-up. You'll be able to get (and record) your user's consent.</li>
            <li>Automatically add a checkbox so your users can decide what to sign-up for.</li>
            <li>Control SMS & Email notification settings separately.</li>
            <li>Automatically control the cookie & privacy policy.</li>
            <li>Control the text and add your own terms.</li>
            <li>Disable access completely if they don't provide consent or opt-out.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Handle User Data Requests</h3>
          <p>Under the GDPR, your users have expanded rights regarding their <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/">personal data</a>. We're adding a number of tools to help you manage these requests yourself.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>You'll see tools within your CT dashboard so you can view, export and delete customer data too.</li>
            <li>Deleting a user will remove all traces of that user's personal information, including MAC addresses. It will also remove them from any charts / reports. Anonymised / aggregated data won't be touched.</li>
          </ul>

        <h3>Trusted Providers Only</h3>
        <p>If you're syncing your email addresses with your fave tools, like MailChimp, you'll need to let your users know who you're sharing with and why you're sharing.</p>
        <p>Since it's your responsibility to use GDPR compliant suppliers, we've created a carefully created list of companies you can integrate with.</p>

        <h3>Keep your data handling / processing compliant</h3>
        <p>Since you might already processing user data with CT, you might also wonder if the data you've already captured is OK? Once the new splash pages have been introduced, your data will be fully compliant. </p>
        <p>If not, you might have captured data without the correct consent. If this is the case, you'll be able to use the CT email & SMS tools to ask for consent again. It's better to be safe than sorry.</p>

        <h3>What Happens Next</h3>
        <p>These tools will be added over the coming weeks, including new terms and privacy policies. If you're processing customer data yourself, you'll need to ensure your own terms have been updated. GDPR comes into effect on May 25th 2018 but there's still time to get sorted.</p>
